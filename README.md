# Palnagotchi for M5 Cardputer

This is meant to be a friendly unit for those lonely Pwnagotchis out there. It's written to run on the M5 Cardputer, but I'll try to add support to other M5 devices in the future.

It is still a WIP, as I'm learning the protocol and low level programming. So no, it doesn't do anything as it is right now.
